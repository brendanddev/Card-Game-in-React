# Assignment #3 - Card Game in React By Brendan Dileo

### About The Project
This project is a *React JS Deck of Cards application* made for my third assignment in Mobile Web Programming.
The goal of this project was to allow users to manipulate a deck of 52 cards, through different interactive features.
The application allows the user to deal cards, reset the deck of cards, toss a card (remove), create a wildcard, and shuffle the cards dealt to them. Users are able to pick a card by clicking onto it, or swap the cards.
